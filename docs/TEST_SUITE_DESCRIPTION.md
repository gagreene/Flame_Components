# Test Suite Description

**114 tests** across three groups: `tests/unit/` (102), `tests/integration/` (7),
`tests/regression/` (5). Run with `pytest tests/ -v` (or `uv run pytest tests/ -v`).

## Overview

`flame_components` computes fire-behavior metrics (mid-flame wind speed, flame length,
height, tilt, residence time, depth) from scalar or `numpy.ndarray` inputs. Every public
function shares two conventions the test suite verifies throughout:

1. **NaN propagation via `numpy.ma`.** Inputs are converted to masked arrays with NaN
   cells masked. Masked cells must produce NaN in the output (`.filled(nan)`), never a
   garbage value from `numpy.ma`'s internal domain-safe fill — `numpy.ma`'s "domained"
   ufuncs (`ma.divide`, `ma.power`, `ma.log`, ...) substitute an internal safe value into
   masked positions before computing, so only `.filled(nan)` guarantees a literal NaN.
   Every `test_nan_propagates` test in this suite exercises this contract.
2. **Two failure modes for bad input, deliberately different:**
   - **Type/argument errors** (wrong type, missing required argument, unknown enum
     value like an invalid `model` or `units` string) → raise `TypeError` or
     `ValueError` immediately, with a clear message.
   - **Numerically degenerate input** (division by zero, a value outside a formula's
     mathematical domain such as `arccos` of a ratio > 1) → return `NaN`, consistent
     with the NaN-propagation contract. This is intentional, not a gap — see
     "Documented NaN-for-undefined behaviors" below — and is distinct from case 1
     precisely because the input *type* and *shape* were valid; only the numeric
     combination was undefined.
   - Every function also floors negative results at exactly `0` where negative
     values are physically meaningless (e.g. depth, wind speed, residence time),
     rather than propagating a negative number.

This distinction is why the test suite pairs almost every function with both an
"Errors" class (asserting a clean exception) and explicit NaN/clamping tests
(asserting the degenerate-but-valid-type case) — collapsing the two into "should not
crash" would hide real, meaningfully different failure modes.

### Documented NaN-for-undefined behaviors

These are asserted explicitly in the suite so a future change can't silently alter
them without a test failing — they are the *other* half of the two-failure-modes
convention above:

- `get_flame_residence_time(ros=0, ...)` → `NaN` (division by zero; no fire spread
  means residence time is undefined, not simply "missing").
- `get_flame_length('Finney_HEAD', ..., flame_depth=0)` → `NaN` (division by
  `flame_depth**0.161`; zero depth is undefined for this model).
- `get_flame_length(..., fire_intensity=<negative>)` → `NaN` (a fractional power of a
  negative number is undefined in the reals).
- `get_flame_tilt('Standard', flame_length=L, flame_height=H)` with `H > L` → `NaN`
  (`arccos(H/L)` requires `H/L` in `[0, 1]`; a flame can't be taller than its own
  length).

## Unit tests (`tests/unit/`)

One file per public function, one for the multiprocessing dispatcher, and one for the
public `__all__` surface. Per-function files have up to three classes:
`*Scalar`/model-named classes (happy-path + edge-case behavior for scalar input),
`*Array` (vectorized behavior, shape, NaN propagation), and `*Errors` (invalid input
raises the right exception type).

### `test_public_api.py` (1 test)

| Test | What & why |
|---|---|
| `test_all_contains_only_snake_case_names` | `flame_components.__all__` contains exactly the 7 snake_case public function names — `from flame_components import *` must not surface implementation details like private helpers. |

### `test_get_mid_flame_ws.py` (14 tests)

Tests Albini & Baughman (1979) mid-flame wind speed under a canopy.

| Test | What & why |
|---|---|
| `test_si_returns_positive_float` | Valid SI-unit inputs produce a positive result — basic happy path. |
| `test_imp_returns_positive_float` | Same, for IMP units — confirms the IMP branch also runs end-to-end. |
| `test_zero_wind_returns_zero` | Zero input wind speed must produce zero output (formula is linear in wind speed; catches an accidental additive constant). |
| `test_returns_float_not_array` | Scalar in → scalar out, not a length-1 `ndarray` — callers doing arithmetic on the result would break if this silently changed. |
| `test_canopy_ht_zero_warns` | `canopy_ht=0` must emit `UserWarning` mentioning `canopy_ht` (documented zero-division guard). |
| `test_canopy_ht_zero_returns_non_negative` | After the warned substitution (0 → 0.5 m equivalent), the result must still be usable (non-negative), not `NaN` or an exception. |
| `test_si_and_imp_agree_for_equivalent_inputs` | A wind speed and canopy geometry expressed in SI vs. IMP units, converted correctly for the documented 10-m/20-ft reference-height difference, must produce the same result. Catches silent unit-conversion drift between the two code paths. |
| `test_negative_wind_speed_clamped_to_zero` | Negative wind speed (non-physical) is floored at exactly `0`, not left negative. |
| `test_array_output_shape` | Array input produces same-shape array output. |
| `test_array_all_non_negative` | Vectorized results respect the same non-negativity floor as the scalar path. |
| `test_nan_propagates` | NaN in one array element masks only that element's output; sibling elements are unaffected. |
| `test_invalid_units_raises` | `units='METRIC'` (not `'SI'`/`'IMP'`) raises `ValueError`. |
| `test_non_string_units_raises` | Non-string `units` (e.g. `42`) raises `TypeError` before the `ValueError` string check even runs. |
| `test_string_wind_speed_raises` | Wrong type for `wind_speed` raises `TypeError`. |

### `test_get_flame_length.py` (16 tests)

Tests the 28 published fire-intensity-to-flame-length correlations (Finney & Grumstrup
2023), keyed by `model`.

| Test | What & why |
|---|---|
| `test_byram_head_known_value` | `Byram_HEAD` model against a hand-computed value (`0.0775 * 100**0.46`) — anchors the whole `model_dict` lookup/power-law mechanism to a known-correct number. |
| `test_zero_intensity_returns_zero` | Zero fire intensity → zero flame length (`0**0.46 = 0`), not `NaN` or an error — zero intensity is a valid, defined input (no fire), unlike zero `flame_depth` below. |
| `test_returns_float_not_array` | Scalar in → scalar out. |
| `test_non_negative` | Basic non-negativity floor. |
| `test_params_only_returns_tuple` | `params_only=True` returns the raw `(a, b)` model-parameter tuple instead of computing a length — an alternate code path worth covering directly since it returns early, before any masked-array math runs. |
| `test_finney_head_without_flame_depth_raises` | `Finney_HEAD` is the one model requiring `flame_depth`; omitting it must raise `ValueError`, not silently divide by `None`. |
| `test_finney_head_known_value` | `Finney_HEAD` (`fl = 0.01051 * I^0.774 / D^0.161`) against a hand-computed value — anchors the coefficient/exponent tuple for this special three-parameter model, the only one requiring `flame_depth`. |
| `test_finney_head_zero_flame_depth_is_undefined_returns_nan` | **Documented NaN case:** dividing by `flame_depth**0.161` at `flame_depth=0` is undefined; asserts `NaN`, not a crash or a silently wrong number. |
| `test_negative_fire_intensity_is_undefined_returns_nan` | **Documented NaN case:** a fractional power of a negative number is undefined in the reals. |
| `test_params_only_non_bool_raises_type_error` | `params_only='yes'` (a truthy non-bool) must raise `TypeError`, not be silently treated as `True`. |
| `test_array_output_shape` | Array input produces same-shape output. |
| `test_monotone_increasing_with_intensity` | Higher intensity → strictly longer flame — a coarse sanity check on the power-law's sign/exponent that a unit test on a single value can't catch (e.g. a flipped exponent could still hit one lucky matching value). |
| `test_nan_propagates` | NaN masking, standard pattern. |
| `test_invalid_model_name_raises` | Unknown `model` string raises `ValueError` listing valid options. |
| `test_non_string_model_raises` | Non-string `model` raises `TypeError`. |
| `test_string_intensity_raises` | Wrong type for `fire_intensity` raises `TypeError`. |

### `test_get_flame_height.py` (21 tests)

Tests two independent models: Nelson & Adkins (1986) (uses fire intensity + wind) and
Finney & Martin (1992) (uses tilt + slope).

| Test | What & why |
|---|---|
| `test_surface_fire_known_value` | Nelson model, `fire_type=1`, against a hand-computed value — anchors the `a` coefficient and the core `a*I/ws` formula. |
| `test_zero_wind_returns_flame_length` | `midflame_ws=0` → height equals `flame_length` (a windless flame stands straight up) — this is a distinct branch (`ma.where(midflame_ws==0, flame_length, ...)`), not just "another number," so it needs its own test. |
| `test_height_capped_at_flame_length` | A computed height exceeding `flame_length` is capped there — physically, flame height can't exceed flame length. |
| `test_string_surface_equals_integer_1` | String (`'surface'`) and integer (`1`) `fire_type` inputs must produce identical results — the `fire_type_dict` translation layer must be a true no-op equivalence, not a numerically-close-but-different path. |
| `test_active_crown_uses_larger_a_coefficient` | Crown fires (`fire_type=3`) use a materially larger coefficient (`0.0175` vs `1/360`) — asserts the *direction* of the difference, catching a swapped-coefficient bug that a single-value test might not. |
| `test_passive_crown_same_coefficient_as_surface` | `fire_type=2` ("passive crown") shares the surface-fire coefficient — a deliberate, easy-to-invert domain rule worth pinning down explicitly. |
| `test_returns_float_not_array` | Scalar in → scalar out. |
| `test_non_negative` | Basic non-negativity floor. |
| `test_invalid_integer_fire_type_raises` | `fire_type=99` (outside the valid `{1,2,3}` domain) raises `ValueError` rather than silently computing a meaningless crown-coefficient result. |
| `test_zero_fire_type_raises` | `fire_type=0` is likewise outside the valid `{1,2,3}` domain and must raise. |
| `test_zero_tilt_vertical_flame_equals_flame_length` | Finney model, `flame_tilt=0` on flat ground → height equals `flame_length` (vertical flame) — anchors the trigonometric identity at its simplest case. |
| `test_45_degree_tilt_flat_ground` | 45° tilt against the exact `sin(π/4)` value — a second, non-trivial anchor point for the trig formula. |
| `test_percent_slope_units_accepted` | `slope_units='percent'` is accepted and produces a sane (non-negative) result — exercises the alternate slope-unit conversion branch. |
| `test_non_negative_on_steep_slope` | Non-negativity floor holds even on a steep slope, where the more complex (non-flat-ground) formula branch is active. |
| `test_array_output_shape` | Array input produces same-shape output. |
| `test_array_all_non_negative` | Vectorized non-negativity floor. |
| `test_nan_propagates` | NaN masking, standard pattern. |
| `test_invalid_model_raises` | Unknown `model` raises `ValueError`. |
| `test_nelson_without_fire_type_raises` | Nelson model's three required arguments are enforced together — omitting any one raises `ValueError`. |
| `test_finney_without_slope_raises` | Finney model's required arguments are enforced together. |
| `test_non_string_model_raises` | Non-string `model` raises `TypeError`. |

### `test_get_flame_tilt.py` (21 tests)

Tests three independent models: Standard geometry (flat ground), Finney & Martin
(1992) (sloped ground), and Butler et al. (2004) (crown fires, wind-driven).

| Test | What & why |
|---|---|
| `test_vertical_flame_zero_tilt` | Standard model, `height == length` → `arccos(1) = 0°` — anchors the vertical-flame boundary. |
| `test_horizontal_flame_90_degrees` | `height = 0` → `arccos(0) = 90°` — anchors the horizontal-flame boundary, the opposite extreme from the previous test. |
| `test_arccos_half_equals_60_degrees` | A non-boundary value (`height/length = 0.5`) against the exact `arccos(0.5) = 60°` — confirms the formula isn't just correct at the two easy extremes. |
| `test_returns_float_not_array` | Scalar in → scalar out. |
| `test_non_negative` | Basic non-negativity floor. |
| `test_height_exceeds_length_is_undefined_returns_nan` | **Documented NaN case:** `height > length` pushes `arccos`'s argument outside `[-1, 1]`; a flame can't be taller than its own length, so this is genuinely undefined, not just unusual. |
| `test_flat_ground_returns_non_negative` | Finney model on flat ground (`slope_angle=0`) is a distinct formula branch (`slope_angle <= 1`) from the sloped case; verifies it at least produces a sane result. |
| `test_percent_slope_matches_equivalent_degree_slope` | A 20% slope (`slope_units='percent'`) and its equivalent `arctan(0.20)` degree value (`slope_units='degrees'`) must produce the same tilt — confirms the percent-to-radians conversion is numerically correct, not just branch-reachable. |
| `test_butler_returns_positive_tilt` | Butler model (crown fire + wind) produces a positive tilt — basic happy path for the third, independent model. |
| `test_higher_wind_produces_more_tilt` | Stronger wind → greater tilt (monotonicity) — a directional sanity check the exact-value tests below can't provide on their own. |
| `test_mph_units_matches_equivalent_kph` | `36 km/h` and its exact `22.3694 mph` equivalent must produce the same tilt — confirms the `mph`→m/s conversion factor is correct, not just that the branch runs. |
| `test_mps_units_matches_equivalent_kph` | `36 km/h` and its exact `10 m/s` equivalent must produce the same tilt — confirms the "no conversion needed" `mps` branch is truly a no-op, not just reachable. |
| `test_zero_canopy_ht_raises` | `canopy_ht=0` (Butler model divides by it) raises a clean `ValueError` rather than leaking a raw `ZeroDivisionError`. |
| `test_negative_canopy_ht_raises` | Negative `canopy_ht` is equally non-physical and must raise the same `ValueError`. |
| `test_string_canopy_ht_raises_type_error` | Wrong type for `canopy_ht` raises `TypeError` before reaching any arithmetic. |
| `test_array_output_shape` | Array input produces same-shape output. |
| `test_nan_propagates` | NaN masking via `flame_length`, standard pattern. |
| `test_nan_propagates_via_canopy_ht_butler_model` | NaN in a `canopy_ht` array (Butler model) masks only the affected element — verifies the masking contract holds for `canopy_ht` specifically, not just the scalar zero/negative domain checks above. |
| `test_invalid_model_raises` | Unknown `model` raises `ValueError`. |
| `test_standard_missing_flame_height_raises` | Standard model's required arguments enforced. |
| `test_butler_missing_canopy_ht_raises` | Butler model's required arguments enforced. |

### `test_get_flame_residence_time.py` (11 tests)

Tests Nelson & Adkins (1988) flame residence time.

| Test | What & why |
|---|---|
| `test_known_value_seconds` | Hand-computed value (`0.39 * 1**0.25 * 1**1.51 / (1/60) = 23.4`) anchors the formula in its default output unit. |
| `test_known_value_minutes` | Same inputs with `units='min'` — confirms the `/60` output-unit conversion is applied correctly and consistently with the seconds case. |
| `test_returns_float_not_array` | Scalar in → scalar out. |
| `test_negative_ros_clamped_to_zero` | Negative `ros` flips the formula's sign; result is floored at exactly `0`. |
| `test_zero_ros_is_undefined_returns_nan` | **Documented NaN case:** `ros=0` (no fire spread) divides by zero in the `ros/60` denominator; residence time is genuinely undefined, not just zero or missing. |
| `test_array_output_shape` | Array input produces same-shape output. |
| `test_array_all_non_negative` | Vectorized non-negativity floor. |
| `test_nan_propagates` | NaN masking, standard pattern. |
| `test_string_ros_raises` | Wrong type for `ros` raises `TypeError`. |
| `test_invalid_units_raises` | `units='seconds'` (a plausible typo for `'sec'`) raises `ValueError` rather than silently behaving like `'sec'`. |
| `test_non_string_units_raises` | Non-string `units` raises `TypeError`. |

### `test_get_flame_depth.py` (11 tests)

Tests Fons et al. (1963) flame depth: `fd = ros * res_time` — the simplest function in
the library (a single multiplication), so its tests focus on the clamping and
NaN-propagation contract rather than formula correctness.

| Test | What & why |
|---|---|
| `test_known_value` | `2.0 * 3.0 = 6.0` exactly — trivial but confirms no unexpected transformation (e.g. an accidental unit conversion) is applied. |
| `test_zero_ros` | Zero rate of spread → zero depth (valid, defined input; contrast with `get_flame_residence_time`'s `ros=0`, which is a *denominator* there and produces `NaN` instead). |
| `test_zero_res_time` | Zero residence time → zero depth, by symmetry with the previous test. |
| `test_returns_float_not_array` | Scalar in → scalar out. |
| `test_negative_ros_clamped_to_zero` | Negative `ros` makes the product negative; asserts the *exact* clamped value (`0.0`), not just non-negativity. |
| `test_negative_res_time_clamped_to_zero` | Symmetric case for negative `res_time` — both multiplicands' negative-clamping paths are covered independently. |
| `test_array_output_shape` | Array input produces same-shape output. |
| `test_array_known_values` | Element-wise multiplication against hand-computed values `[2, 6, 12]`. |
| `test_nan_propagates` | NaN masking, standard pattern. |
| `test_string_ros_raises_type_error` | Wrong type for `ros` raises `TypeError`. |
| `test_string_res_time_raises_type_error` | Wrong type for `res_time` raises `TypeError`. |

### `test_flame_component_array_multiprocessing.py` (7 tests)

Tests the block-splitting multiprocessing dispatcher.

| Test | What & why |
|---|---|
| `test_matches_direct_call_when_concatenated` | The dispatcher returns a **list of per-block arrays**, not a single concatenated array (see its docstring's `NOTE`). Concatenating the blocks must reproduce exactly what calling `get_flame_depth` directly on the full array would give — the core correctness guarantee of the whole dispatcher. |
| `test_explicit_block_size_produces_expected_block_count` | An explicit `block_size` produces the expected number of correctly-sized blocks — verifies the block-splitting logic itself, independent of the underlying calculation. |
| `test_num_processors_less_than_two_warns_and_still_runs` | `num_processors=1` emits a `UserWarning` and completes successfully with the documented `num_processors=2` fallback, rather than raising. |
| `test_num_processors_zero_warns_and_still_runs` | Same fallback path exercised at the `num_processors=0` boundary. |
| `test_unknown_flame_function_raises` | An unrecognized `flame_function` key raises `ValueError` listing the valid options. |
| `test_no_array_inputs_raises` | All-scalar `kwargs` gives the dispatcher nothing to split into blocks; raises `ValueError` rather than silently doing no work. |
| `test_mismatched_array_shapes_raises` | Two input arrays of different shapes can't be split into matching blocks; raises `ValueError`. |

---

## Integration tests (`tests/integration/test_flame_pipeline.py`) (7 tests)

Unlike the unit tests (one function, isolated), these chain multiple functions the way
a real fire-behavior workflow would, verifying that one function's output is valid
input to the next — a class of bug unit tests can't catch (e.g. a unit mismatch between
two functions that are each individually correct).

| Test | What & why |
|---|---|
| `test_scalar_pipeline_produces_positive_depth` | `get_flame_residence_time` → `get_flame_depth`: residence time output feeds into flame depth without type errors and produces a physically sane (positive) result. |
| `test_residence_depth_pipeline_known_value` | Same pipeline against a hand-computed exact value (`ros=fuel_consumption=midflame_ws=1.0` → `res_time=flame_depth=0.39`) — pins a fixed numeric result through both functions, catching unit-conversion drift that a positivity-only check can't. |
| `test_array_pipeline_preserves_shape` | Same pipeline, vectorized: shape is preserved end-to-end and all values stay non-negative through both functions' clamping. |
| `test_scalar_height_bounded_by_flame_length` | `get_mid_flame_ws` → `get_flame_length` → `get_flame_height`: chains three functions and asserts the Nelson model's height-capped-at-length invariant still holds when the inputs come from upstream calculations rather than hand-picked values. |
| `test_array_pipeline_shape_and_bounds` | Same three-function pipeline, vectorized. |
| `test_roundtrip_recovers_original_height` | `get_flame_tilt` (Standard) → `get_flame_height` (Finney, flat ground) is a mathematical identity on flat ground (`height → tilt = arccos(h/L) → height = L·cos(tilt) = h`); recovering the original height confirms the two independently-implemented models (Standard tilt geometry and Finney height geometry) are consistent with each other, not just each internally correct. |
| `test_nan_in_ros_propagates_to_depth` | NaN in one element of a pipeline's array input must contaminate only that element all the way through two chained functions, without affecting sibling elements — the multi-function analogue of each unit test's single-function `test_nan_propagates`. |

---

## Regression tests (`tests/regression/test_gotchas.py`) (5 tests)

Pinned reproductions of specific historical bugs, kept permanently so they can never
silently reappear. Unlike the edge-case tests above (which test *behavior contracts*),
these test *specific past incidents*.

| Test | What & why |
|---|---|
| `test_string_fire_type_surface_does_not_raise` | Historical Bug: `fire_type`'s `isinstance` guard didn't include `str`, so `fire_type='surface'` raised `TypeError` even though string fire types are documented as valid. |
| `test_string_fire_type_active_crown_does_not_raise` | Same bug, second valid string value — confirms the fix isn't value-specific. |
| `test_string_fire_type_with_array_midflame_ws` | A second historical bug compounded the first: the `isinstance` check for the *numeric* fire_type branch mistakenly checked `midflame_ws` instead of `fire_type`, so this combination (string `fire_type` + array `midflame_ws`) raised `AttributeError`. Both fixes are required simultaneously for this case to pass. |
| `test_kwargs_signature_accepts_keyword_arguments` | Historical bug: `flame_component_array_multiprocessing` accepted `*kwargs` (a positional tuple) instead of `**kwargs` (a keyword dict), so calling it with keyword arguments (the only way its API is documented to be used) raised `TypeError`. Also asserts the concatenated block results are numerically identical to a direct `get_flame_residence_time` call — not just that no exception occurs. |
| `test_flame_residence_key_resolves_to_valid_function` | Historical bug: the dispatcher's function-name lookup string was `'getFlameResidence'` (missing `'Time'`), so `globals().get(...)` returned `None` and the dispatcher raised "function does not exist" for a documented, valid key. Also asserts the concatenated block results are numerically identical to a direct `get_flame_residence_time` call — the resolved function must be correct, not merely resolvable. |
